Any type that implements the `Eq` and `Hash` traits can be a key in `HashMap`. 
This includes:

* `bool` (though not very useful since there is only two possible keys)
* `int`, `uint`, and all variations thereof
* `String` and `&str` (protip: you can have a `HashMap` keyed by `String`
and call `.get()` with an `&str`)

Note that `f32` and `f64` do *not* implement `Hash`,
likely because [floating-point precision errors][floating]
would make using them as hashmap keys horribly error-prone.

All collection classes implement `Eq` and `Hash` 
if their contained type also respectively implements `Eq` and `Hash`. 
For example, `Vec<T>` will implement `Hash` if `T` implements `Hash`.

You can easily implement `Eq` and `Hash` for a custom type with just one line: 
`#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]`

The compiler will do the rest. If you want more control over the details, 
you can implement `Eq` and/or `Hash` yourself. 
This guide will not cover the specifics of implementing `Hash`. 

To play around with using a `struct` in `HashMap`, 
let's try making a very simple user logon system:
