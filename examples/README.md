# Rust by Example

[Rust][rust] is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety, speed,
and concurrency. It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using 
garbage collection.

Rust by Example (RBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust
concepts and standard libraries. To get even more out of these examples, don't forget
to [install Rust locally][install] and check out the [official docs][std]. 
Additionally for the curious, you can also [check out the source code for this site][home].
